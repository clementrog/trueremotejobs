<h1>Hello!</h1>
<p>It's hard to find true remote jobs.
  <br>
  So many companies advertise their jobs as "remote" while building cultures of real-time communication, hiring in very limited timezones, and scattering access to internal information. There must be way to match people and companies who are intentional about how they work remotely.
  <br>
  That's why I'm trying to build. More to come soon!
